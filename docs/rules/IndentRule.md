# Indent lines

Moves all commands and comments to the correct indentation.

Relative indents within the lines of a command \(or command chain\) are not changed by this rule.

This rule is part of the **essential** profile, as it is explicitly demanded by the [Clean ABAP Styleguide](https://github.com/SAP/styleguides/blob/main/clean-abap/CleanABAP.md).

## Options

* \[X\] Execute on CLASS ... DEFINITION sections
* Align with following ELSEIF or ELSE \[if comment is preceded by blank line\]
* Align with following WHEN \[if comment is preceded by blank line\]
* Align with following CATCH or CLEANUP \[if comment is preceded by blank line\]

## Examples


```ABAP

METHOD pretty_print_indent.
DO 4 TIMES.
LOOP AT its_table ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<ls_row>).
IF <ls_row>-ignore = abap_true.
" comment
CONTINUE.
ENDIF.
TRY.
" comment
IF iv_value = 1.
" comment on next line
iv_value += 3.
" comment with no empty line above it
ELSEIF iv_value = 2.
iv_value += 2.

" comment on ELSE branch with an empty line above it
ELSE.
iv_value += 1.
ENDIF.

CASE iv_value.
" comment on WHEN
WHEN 1.
" comment on next line
iv_value += 1.

" comment on WHEN with an empty line above it
WHEN 2.
iv_value += 2.
" comment with no empty line above it
WHEN 3.
iv_value += 3.
ENDCASE.

" comment on CATCH with an empty line above it
CATCH cx_any.
" no handler
ENDTRY.
ENDLOOP.
ENDDO.
ENDMETHOD.
